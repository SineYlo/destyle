> This is an updated version of the destyle.css stylesheet

📌 Author of the original version 3.0.0 - https://github.com/nicolas-cusan/destyle.css 

## ⚜️ What's new I added in version 3.0.1:

1. Added a fix that fixes `placeholder` color in Firefox browsers
2. The file received a more beautiful design (at least it seems so to me)
3. Added an edit that removes the annoying cross in the `[type="search"]` field
4. Rearranged styles according to the style guide

## 💻 Browser support

- Chrome (Chrome Canary)
- Edge
