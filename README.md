> This is an updated version of the destyle.css stylesheet.

📌 Author of the original version 2.0.2 - https://github.com/nicolas-cusan/destyle.css

### ⚠️ What's new I added in version 2.0.3:

1. Removed from all form elements (outline: 0;) since if a custom one is not added it will have a bad effect on availability
2. The file received a more beautiful design (at least it seems so to me).
3. Added an edit that removes the annoying cross in the `[type="search"]` field
