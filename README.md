### ⚙️ Changelog:
#### v3.0.2 / 2021-11-10
- Added `white-space` property with value `revert` to textarea element. This property returns this element for the `Safari` browser
- Added the `max-width: 100%` and `height: auto` properties to the `img` element, which will allow the element to shrink proportionally and also prevent the image from going beyond the parent's bounds
