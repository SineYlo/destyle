## üå† Why was this version created
Initially, I doubt whether to release my own version of Destyle or not, but then I decided that it would make sense. We live on a planet full of people, and they are all different. Someone wants one thing, and someone else. It's hard enough to please everyone, but I tried to at least get close to it. The original version of Destyle does not give a choice. Only one option. I have three of them. You can use a basic reset by tags. If you don't like it, there is an option to reset through classes. Well, if this option is not suitable, then there are mixins that solve many problems. You have the right to choose the option that you like the lost and is suitable for a particular task.
